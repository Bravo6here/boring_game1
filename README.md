Game about making player to touch coin. Autoplay AI included.

To make it work:
1. Change paths of "collision", "plimg", "stimg". Place of path is in Raw string and you can just copypaste it.
2. Make sure you have Pygame installed. Installing by "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame".
3. That's all. You can play the game.

Controls:

W or arrowUp = Up 

S or arrowDown = Down

A or arrowLeft = Left

D or arrowRight = Right

Q = Turning on/off autoplay AI



Note:

I If you hold Q the AI will start switching between on and off and AIs movement be slow and strange. Also pressing movement keys while AI is running will resoult into AI having different speed or not being as accurate and in rare cases AI can miss starcoin entirely.
