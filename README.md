To make it work:
1. Change paths of "collision", "plimg", "stimg". Place of path is in Raw string and you can just copypaste it.
2. Make sure you have Pygame installed. Installing by "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame".
3. That's all. You can play the game.

Controls:

W or arrowUp = Up 

S or arrowDown = Down

A or arrowLeft = Left

D or arrowRight = Right

Q = Turning on/off autoplay AI



Note:

Holding key works on WSAD only. Holding arrows does not work. 

If you press Q and Ai will not start try hoding Q. If you hold Q for a long time the AI will start switching between on and off and AIs movement be slow and strange.
